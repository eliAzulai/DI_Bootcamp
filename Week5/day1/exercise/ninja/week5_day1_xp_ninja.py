# Exercise 1 : Call History
# Instructions
# 1. Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. When instantiating an 
# object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.

# 2. Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. 
# The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.

# 3. Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.

# 4. Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.

# 5. Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. Each message should be saved as a 
# dictionary with the following keys:

# to
# from
# content

# Create the following methods: show_outgoing_messages(self), show_incoming_messages(self), show_messages_from(self, number)

# Test your code !!!
# message = [{
#     to 
# }]
